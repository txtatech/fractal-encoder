This testing folder's contents are a part of two projects found here:

https://github.com/txtatech/fractal-encoder

And a related project found here:

https://github.com/txtatech/frac-crawl

The goal of both projects (in short) is to encode large amounts of text as fractal images.

The other goals of the projects are more involving to explain so I suggest reading their README files. 

Please note that all of the sub-folders in the 'outputs' folder are necessary and the 'input' folder
is intentionally placed inside it to keep the required number of directories to a minimum in the other projects.

To create fractals do:

python3 afrac-main.py

You can then look in the 'outputs/crawl' directory to see the .PNG, .SVG and .TXT files that were created from the contents
of the 'afractest.txt' file found in the 'outputs/input' folder.

In the 'outputs/ledgers' folder two ledgers are created named 'acentral_ledger.txt' and 'aledger.json'
